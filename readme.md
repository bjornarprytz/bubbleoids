# soundship

game on itch.io: [link](https://thewarlock.itch.io/soundship)

## TODO

- Screens
  - game name?
  - credits?

- Tweak controls
  - Stay in orbit
  - move up and down
  - Slingshot out?

- UI
  - Move to screen space
  - Goal tracker
  - indicate which planets are undiscovered

- Maintain planet state (when re-scrolling a sector)

### Bugs

- Sometimes infinite scroll doesn't scroll properly
- Gamepad on web doesn't work: ship doesn't turn

### Nice to have

- Different dance moves (depending on instrument?)
- Space HUD. eg:
  - Matching gravity...
  - Orbit acquired.

- Push release with `./push_release.sh`

### Extra

- itch.io
  - Rename the game
  - Write a short description
  - Make a nice cover image (630x500)
  - Add screenshots (recommended: 3-5)
  - Pick a genre
  - Add a tag or two
  - Publish a devlog on instagram
